## Findings

Energy Innovation released a report, [California Energy Policy Simulator Update: Earlier Action Delivers Social and Economic Benefits](https://energyinnovation.org/publication/california-energy-policy-simulator-update-earlier-action-delivers-social-and-economic-benefits/), which explores the current state policy mix and options for deeper decarbonization using the California EPS. Full documentation for the scenario assumptions can be found at the documentation links below.

## Documentation

Documentation of source data, assumptions, and policy scenarios is available [here](https://github.com/Energy-Innovation/eps-california/raw/main/Policy%20Assumptions%20and%20Sources.docx). 
Documentation of the model is available [here](https://us.energypolicy.solutions/docs/index.html).  Documentation is not specific to any model version and therefore applies to both U.S. and California versions of the Energy Policy Simulator.
